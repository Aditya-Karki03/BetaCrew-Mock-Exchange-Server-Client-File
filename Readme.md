# BetaCrew Mock Exchange Client

## Overview

This Node.js application is designed to interact with a mock exchange server to request and receive stock ticker data. The client connects to the server, retrieves packets of data, and ensures that all data sequences are complete and correctly ordered. The final data is saved to a JSON file.

## Requirements

- Node.js version 16.17.0 or higher
- The BetaCrew exchange server should be running on port 3000
